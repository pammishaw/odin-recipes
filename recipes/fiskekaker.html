    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fiskekaker, or Norwegian fish cakes, are a beloved staple in many Scandinavian homes, known for their mild flavor, soft texture, and comforting simplicity. 
        Traditionally made from white fish like cod or haddock, these cakes are blended with milk, flour or potato starch, and gentle spices before being pan-fried to a light golden brown. 
        Unlike heavily seasoned seafood dishes, fiskekaker have a subtle taste that makes them especially popular with children and anyone looking for a lighter, homestyle meal. 
        They’re often served with boiled potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a dollop of tangy remoulade, making them a versatile and wholesome part of everyday Nordic cuisine. </p>
    <p>Beyond their role in a typical weeknight dinner, fiskekaker carry a sense of tradition and regional pride. 
        In coastal towns, local fish markets often offer freshly made versions, each with slight variations passed down through generations. 
        Some might include finely chopped onions, a hint of nutmeg, or even a touch of smoked fish for deeper flavor. 
        Whether served hot off the skillet or packed cold into a lunchbox, fiskekaker offer a taste of Norway’s seafaring heritage and the kind of comfort food that brings people back to family kitchens and familiar routines.</p>
