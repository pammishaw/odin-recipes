    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="recipe-container">
        <p> Root vegetables, hearty grains, and dairy products form the backbone of many traditional dishes—none more beloved than the meatball, or kjøttkaker. 
            While meatballs are common throughout the Nordic region, Norway has its own distinctive twist: a rich, savory gravy made with brunost, or brown cheese. 
            This sweet and tangy cheese, made from caramelized whey, adds a uniquely Nordic depth of flavor that sets these meatballs apart. </p>
        <p>Norwegian brown cheese meatballs are typically made with a blend of ground beef or pork, though modern variations may use poultry or plant-based alternatives. 
            The meatballs are seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and sometimes nutmeg, then pan-fried and simmered in a silky gravy infused with brunost. 
            The result is a beautifully balanced dish—hearty and savory with a subtle hint of sweetness. 
            Traditionally served with boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, and steamed vegetables or cabbage, these meatballs are a staple of Norwegian family dinners, holidays, and Sunday meals. 
            They represent the kind of humble, flavorful cooking that makes Scandinavian food so satisfying.</p>
