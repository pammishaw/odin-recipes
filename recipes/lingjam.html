    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="recipe-container">
        <p>Lingonberry jam is a staple in Nordic kitchens, known for its vibrant red color, tart flavor, and versatility at the table. 
            Made from wild lingonberries—tiny, bright berries that thrive in the forests of Sweden, Norway, and Finland—this jam has a natural sharpness that pairs beautifully with both sweet and savory dishes. 
            Unlike overly sugary jams, lingonberry preserves often retain a slight tang, making them a perfect companion to hearty foods like meatballs, game, liver pate, or root vegetable casseroles.
            A spoonful can brighten up a simple meal, adding a touch of acidity and fruitiness that balances rich or earthy flavors.</p>
        <p>Beyond its bold taste, lingonberry jam carries deep cultural roots in the Nordic region. 
            Many families traditionally pick the berries themselves during late summer and early autumn, turning the harvest into jars of preserves that last through the long winter. 
            It’s a symbol of resourcefulness and connection to nature, often served alongside classic dishes during holiday feasts or everyday dinners. 
            Whether slathered on buttered crispbread, dolloped next to roast meats, or layered into a dessert, lingonberry jam adds not only flavor but a taste of Scandinavian tradition.</p>
